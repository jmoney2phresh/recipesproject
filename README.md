recipes project: Odin Project Foundations

This project is a practice and consolidation exercise from The Odin Project's foundation course.
I will be focusing on quickly and efficiently using HTML, CLI and Git during this short project. 

It's been going very well so far, and I'm finding a lot of flow.

Wish me luck.
